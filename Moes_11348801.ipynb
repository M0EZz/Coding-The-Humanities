    "\n",
    "You are expected to *briefly* explain what you are doing in markdown and by commenting your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonueses:\n",

    "* When you are done coding and you are happy with your results, make sure to run all cells again from the first to the last, then save your notebook.\n",
    "* Click on `File > Download as > .hmtl` and save the html export into the exam's folder.\n",
    "* Close your notebook.\n",
    "* Rename the exam folder with your surname and student id. For example: `colavizza_123456.zip`.\n",
